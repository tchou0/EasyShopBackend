The EasyShopBackEnd Application is a backend Spring Boot Java API project that supports the EasyShop e-commerce website.
It provides the following features:

1. User Registration and Login: Users can create accounts and securely log in to access personalized features and make purchases.

2. Product Display by Category: Users can browse products organized into different categories, making it easier to find desired items.

3. Search and Filtering: Users can search for specific products or apply filters to refine the displayed product list, improving the user experience with more targeted results.

### One interesting piece of code 
               String sql = "SELECT * FROM categories;";
This code retrieves all categories from the database, making it easy to access and use category data in the application.
